## 🧠 Overview

KVCache is an efficient in-memory key-value store specifically optimized for use in Context-Aware Generation (CAG) architectures employing multihead attention. This implementation provides the underlying caching infrastructure to efficiently store and retrieve key-value pairs used in attention mechanisms, enabling faster processing and reduced memory footprint during inference.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Optimized for storage of attention key-value pairs
- Support for multihead attention caching patterns
- Optional expiration time for cached items
- Automatic clearing of expired items
- Thread-safe operations
- Configurable maximum cache size
- Performance stats tracking (hits, misses, etc.)

## ❓ Why KVCache for CAG?

Context-Aware Generation models, particularly those using transformer architectures with multihead attention, benefit from efficient key-value caching:

- ✅ **Reduced Computation**: Avoid redundant attention calculations
- ⚡ **Faster Inference**: Quick retrieval of cached context
- 📦 **Memory Efficiency**: Manage memory footprint with expiration and limits

## 📦 Installation

bash
pip install kvcache

## 🧩 Usage in CAG Applications

### 📌 Basic Integration with Attention Mechanisms

python
from kvcache import KVCache

# Create a new cache configured for attention mechanism storage
attention_cache = KVCache(max_size=10000)

# Store key-value pairs from an attention head
attention_cache.set("layer1_head0_k", key_tensor)
attention_cache.set("layer1_head0_v", value_tensor)

# Retrieve cached attention keys/values during inference
cached_key = attention_cache.get("layer1_head0_k")
cached_value = attention_cache.get("layer1_head0_v")


### 🧠 Multihead Attention Caching

python
for head in range(num_heads):
    attention_cache.set(f"layer{layer}_head{head}_k", key_tensors[head])
    attention_cache.set(f"layer{layer}_head{head}_v", value_tensors[head])

for head in range(num_heads):
    k = attention_cache.get(f"layer{layer}_head{head}_k")
    v = attention_cache.get(f"layer{layer}_head{head}_v")
    # Use k, v in attention computation


### 🕰 Managing Context Window

python
# Set a value that expires after a defined time window
attention_cache.set("token_123_context", context_data, expiry_time=context_window_size)


---

## 📘 API Reference

### `KVCache` Class

#### Constructor

python
KVCache(max_size=10000, cleanup_interval=60)


- `max_size` (int): Maximum number of items the cache can hold
- `cleanup_interval` (int): Interval in seconds for automatic cleanup of expired items

#### Methods

- `get(key, default=None)`
- `set(key, value, expiry_time=None)`
- `delete(key)`
- `clear()`
- `cleanup()`
- `reset_stats()`
- `size()`
- `keys()`
- `values()`
- `items()`

### Cache Statistics (via `attention_cache.stats`)

- `hits`
- `misses`
- `insertions`
- `deletions`
- `expirations`

---

## 🧵 Thread Safety for Parallel Processing

All operations on the `KVCache` are thread-safe, using internal locks to ensure consistency across concurrent reads/writes — ideal for multi-head attention in parallel environments.

---

## 🔁 Example CAG Implementation

python
import time
from kvcache import KVCache

attention_cache = KVCache(max_size=1000)

for token_idx in range(sequence_length):
    for layer in range(num_layers):
        for head in range(num_heads):
            key = compute_key(token_idx, layer, head)  # user-defined
            value = compute_value(token_idx, layer, head)  # user-defined

            cache_key = f"tok{token_idx}_layer{layer}_head{head}_k"
            cache_val_key = f"tok{token_idx}_layer{layer}_head{head}_v"

            attention_cache.set(cache_key, key)
            attention_cache.set(cache_val_key, value)

# Print stats
print("Cache performance:", attention_cache.stats)


> 💡 *Note: `compute_key` and `compute_value` are user-defined functions tailored to your model pipeline.*

---

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- Optimized for O(1) lookup times
- Thread-safe with automatic cleanup
- Tune `max_size` for your model’s token window × attention heads
- For large-scale applications, consider **hierarchical cache layers**
